Project Objective: 
Created a system that generates realistic anime faces.

Techniques Used:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These are deep learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained together to generate new data (anime faces in this case) that is indistinguishable from real data.

Dataset:

Utilized a dataset containing images of anime faces. The dataset size and quality are crucial for training an effective GAN model.

Implementation:
Trained the GAN model using the anime face dataset.
The generator network learns to generate new anime faces, while the discriminator network learns to differentiate between real and generated faces.
Iteratively improve the model's performance until it can produce high-quality anime faces that look realistic.

Outcome:
Generates anime faces that are visually similar to real ones.
Demonstrates the capabilities of GANs in generating complex and diverse images.
Provides a tool for artists, game developers, or enthusiasts to create anime-style characters and artwork.
